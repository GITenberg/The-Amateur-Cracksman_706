description: "The Amateur Cracksman was the original short story collection by E.W.\
  \ Hornung featuring his most famous character, A. J. Raffles, a gentleman thief\
  \ in late Victorian Great Britain. It was first published in 1899. The book was\
  \ very well received and spawned three follow-ups: two more short story collections,\
  \ The Black Mask (1901) and A Thief in the Night (1904), as well as a full-length\
  \ novel, Mr. Justice Raffles in 1909.\nArthur Raffles is a prominent member of London\
  \ society, and a national sporting hero. As a cricketer he regularly represents\
  \ England in Test matches. He uses this as a chance to commit a number of burglaries,\
  \ primarily stealing valuable jewelry from his hosts. In this he is assisted by\
  \ his friend, the younger, idealistic Bunny Manders. Both men are constantly under\
  \ the surveillance of Inspector Mackenzie of Scotland Yard who is always thwarted\
  \ in his attempts to pin the crimes on Raffles.\nIn the final story, \"The Gift\
  \ of the Emperor\", Raffles is called into service on behalf of the Foreign Office\
  \ who wish to recover a valuable pearl from a German diplomat staying in England.\
  \ However, this is only in the TV adaptation; in the book he is working entirely\
  \ for his own profit.\nThe short stories included in the collection are:\n\"The\
  \ Ides of March\"\n\"A Costume Piece\"\n\"Gentlemen and Players\"\n\"Le Premier\
  \ Pas\"\n\"Wilful Murder\"\n\"Nine Points of the Law\"\n\"The Return Match\"\n\"\
